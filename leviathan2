so after a lot of messing around by chatgpt i looked the answer as it complexed it very much the idea is that when system execute a command it execute it in a shell so shell chars such as ; works in there so if the name of the file has shell chars it gets executed but it cant be in the input as after the name of the file then it stop the shell and start new one on the current shell it has to be part of the filename like touch name;sh then the system in this file running the file in leviathan3 privileges probably related to what happend with the getuid setuid in the file.
